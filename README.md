### School Management System Node API

# School Management System

This project is a School Management System built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ORM. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing teachers, students, and courses.

## Features

- **Teachers Management**: CRUD operations for managing teachers.
- **Students Management**: CRUD operations for managing students.
- **Courses Management**: CRUD operations for managing courses.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose ORM**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- **Nodemon**: A utility that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and running locally or remotely.
- Basic understanding of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ORM.
